# PHP-CMS - A Learning Experience

## The Goal
Create a CMS using PHP, Laravel, MySql in hopes of having a greater understanding of full stack development including but not limited to:

- Relational Databases
- Server Requests / Responses
- Handwriting SQL vs. using an ORM
- Decoupling the front and back end of an application and understanding how they talk between each other.

## Development Stack
- PHP 5.5+
- Laravel 4.1
- AngularJS
- jQuery (transitions/animations IE9+)
- MySQL

## Installation Dependencies
- [Composer (PHP Package Management System)](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix)
- [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com/docs/installation)

## Installation Instructions

Install Composer using Brew:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install php55-intl
brew install homebrew/php/composer
```

You should then run `composer install` inside the `php-cms` directory in order to install all the dependencies required to get this up and running

## Disclaimer
This is still in heavy development, many of the features will not work. I work on this when I have off time from other projects.
